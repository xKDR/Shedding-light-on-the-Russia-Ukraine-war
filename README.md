# Shedding Light on the Russia-Ukraine War: Reproducible Research

This repository contains all code, data, and resources required to reproduce the analysis and results from the paper "Shedding Light on the Russia-Ukraine War".

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Enable full transparency and reproducibility for the study of economic impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war using nighttime lights data.
- **Contents:** Jupyter/Colab notebooks, scripts, vector boundary data, and instructions for running the analysis in a cloud-based environment.

## Getting Started

1. **Google Colab Notebook**
   - Run the analysis directly in your browser using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/xKDR/Shedding-light-on-the-Russia-Ukraine-war/blob/main/reproducible_research.ipynb).
   - No manual installation required; all dependencies are handled in the cloud.

2. **Local Setup**
   - Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/xKDR/Shedding-light-on-the-Russia-Ukraine-war.git
     ```
   - Install required packages (see `requirements.txt` if provided).
   - Download vector boundary data and satellite imagery as described in the notebook.

## Data

- **Vector boundary data:** Provided in the `data/` folder or via download links in the notebook.
- **Satellite imagery:** Downloaded automatically by the notebook.

## Reproducibility

- All code and analysis steps are documented in the notebook.
- Plots and results are generated within the same environment for consistency.
- The computational environment is fully specified for cloud-based execution.
